For uploading specially formatted dictionary data to a Neo4j database instance.

## Installation
`pip install neo4j-uploader`


## Usage
In your application
```
from neo4j_uploader import upload

credentials = ("database_uri", "user", "password")
data = {
  "nodes":
  {
    "Person": [
      {"name": "Bob", "age": 30},
      {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}
    ]
  },
  "relationships":
  {
    "KNOWS": [
      {"_from_name": "Bob", "_to_name": "Jane", "since": 2015}
    ]
  }
}
upload(credentials, data, node_key="name)
```

## Arguments
* `credentials` - A tuple of (database_uri, user, password)
* `data` - A dictionary of nodes and relationships to upload. See the Data Argument Format section for more details.
* `node_key` - The name of the key in the nodes dictionary that contains the node name. Defaults to "name"
* `dedupe_nodes` - If True, will not upload duplicate Nodes. Only updates existing with specified properties. Defaults to True
* `dedupe_relationships` - If True, will not created duplicate Relationships. Only updates existing with specified properties. Defaults to True
* `should_overwrite` - If True, will overwrite existing nodes and relationships. Defaults to False


## Data Argument Format
Either a .json string or dictionary can be passed as an arg into the upload() function.
This dictionary must have a key named `nodes` and optionally one named `relationships`

The value for the `nodes` key must be a dictionary, where each key is the primary node label for the node records to upload. The value of each is a list of dictionaries that represent node properties to upload.

The value for the `relationships` key must be a dictionary, where each key is relationship type. The value of each is a list of dictionaries that are the relationship properties to upload.

Every node record dictionary must have a unique key specified in the `node_key` argument. The default is `_uid` if none is provided. Relationships must have both `_from_<node_key>` and `_to_<node_key>` key-values to determine which Nodes a Relationship should connect. By default these would need to be `_from__uid` and `_to__uid` if a node_key is not provided to the `upload()` function.

Example .json using a custom node_key:
```
{
    "node_key": "nid",
    "nodes": {
      "Person": [
        {
          "first_name": "Jaclyn",
          "last_name": "Stacey",
          "nid": "b267e10d-998b-4804-b5a5-fe84b9ee982a"
        },
        {
          "first_name": "Ryan",
          "last_name": "Adam",
          "nid": "0053fd25-71e4-40c1-80ff-f6b7e4211c77"
        }
      ]
    },
    "relationships": {
      "LIVES_WITH": [
        {
          "_from_nid": "b267e10d-998b-4804-b5a5-fe84b9ee982a",
          "_to_nid": "0053fd25-71e4-40c1-80ff-f6b7e4211c77",
          "since" : "2018-02-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
